# cpp-comtrade

(Partial) C++ implementation of COMTRADE 1999 configuration and data file parsing.

This implementation parses most data from the configuration file and all analog data from a binary file. This implementation does not parse digital channel information, and it does not handle multiple different sampling rates.

I am not liable for issues arising from use of this code for personal, research, industrial, or safety-critical applications. However, feel free to fork the code and make your own updates.
